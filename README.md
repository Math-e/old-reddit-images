# Old Reddit Images

Replaces the **\<image\>** links in comments at old Reddit to the image that appears on new Reddit.

You can set a max height for the images in the options.

### To do:

- The same function for *i.reddit* or *preview.reddit* links on some posts
- Not working when loading new comments
